# Finder Node JS

## Concept

Trying to build out a simple api that could search a fictional dataset of products and the locations where they can be found. In no way do I intend to say this is the proper way of doing things, but more just to see if I could do it with a problem set I've dealt with before.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
